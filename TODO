*combine ansatz elements, var_parameters and ansatz type together

1. Create Backgrounds; classes to construct and calculate H, as either a matrix or as quantum_circuits/states on a quantum simulator or
    a real device.
      - matrix  ----- DONE
      - qiskit simulator ---- DONE
      - real device (Rigetti)

2.For the quantum simulator/devices backgrounds implement different methods for calculating <H>
     - UHU*
     - using the  overlap method
     - others?

3. Add functionality to choose encoding method

4.Search for best classical optimizer

5.Add thresholds for convergence

6. Counting number of gates/circuit depth functionality -- DONE

7. Custom ansatz functionality

8.Excited states functionality

9. Multi-threading
    - the matrices for the exponents of the excitation operators can be calculated in parallel

10.Logging


IDEAS for algorithms and papers:
-ADAPT based on energy contribution
-fixed shape ansatz circuit
-computing excited states
-other VQE applications


Notes:
1. QUBIT ORDER
-qiskit uses the right most qubit as the MSB; statevector simulator produces correct statevector
-openfermion produces statevector corresponding to reversed qubit order

2. State preparation of QISKIT requires much more time than energy calculation
=> therefore no point finding explicitly the <H> when simulating
