-scripts to generate data for dissociation curve plots

-gradient based adapt VQE

-combine qubit_hamiltonian, fci_energy, hf_enerfy etc.. in class molecule and remove them from vqe_runner DONE
-create function commutator for class q_sysyem and the option to save commutators

*********************************************

1. Implementation for Riggeti real QPU

2.For the quantum simulator/devices backgrounds implement different methods for calculating <H>
     - UHU*
     - using the  overlap method
     - others?

3. Add functionality to choose encoding method


8.Excited states functionality

11.Custom optimizer?

12. Decrease qubits/orbitals considered whenever possible??

13. A method to calculate parameter gradients, to feed to a non-gradient free optimizer

14.(create a custom optimizer!!!)


DONE:

0. Try using only double excitations

4.Search for best classical optimizer

10. Logging

9. Multi-threading

13. New criteria when to add ansatz element


IDEAS for algorithms and papers:
-ADAPT based on energy contribution (DONE)
    - iterate through elements until find a significant contribution, not maximum
-computing excited states
-other VQE applications
-different classical optimizers for different ansatz elements: gradient descent for excitations; direct search otherwise
****************
-GO CRAZY: try implemented ML for ansatz optimization
****************


Notes:
1. QUBIT ORDER
-qiskit uses the right most qubit as the MSB; statevector simulator produces correct statevector
-openfermion produces statevector corresponding to reversed qubit order

2. State preparation of QISKIT requires much more time than energy calculation
=> therefore no point finding explicitly the <H> when simulating

3. Adaptive ansatz should theoretically correct for Trotter approximation
