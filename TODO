**********************
1. Implementation for Riggeti real QPU

2.For the quantum simulator/devices backgrounds implement different methods for calculating <H>
     - UHU*
     - using the  overlap method
     - others?

3. Add functionality to choose encoding method

4.Search for best classical optimizer

5.Add thresholds for convergence

8.Excited states functionality

11.Custom optimizer?

DONE:

10. Logging

9. Multi-threading

13. New criteria when to add ansatz element


IDEAS for algorithms and papers:
-ADAPT based on energy contribution (DONE)
    - iterate through elements until find a significant contribution, not maximum
-computing excited states
-other VQE applications
-different classical optimizers for different ansatz elements: gradient descent for excitations; direct search otherwise

-GO CRAZY: try implemented ML for ansatz optimization

Notes:
1. QUBIT ORDER
-qiskit uses the right most qubit as the MSB; statevector simulator produces correct statevector
-openfermion produces statevector corresponding to reversed qubit order

2. State preparation of QISKIT requires much more time than energy calculation
=> therefore no point finding explicitly the <H> when simulating

3. Adaptive ansatz should theoretically correct for Trotter approximation
