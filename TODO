-make excitation_gradient to work for non zero points

-use class Ansatz

-include default ground state ansatz in q_systems

-remove the option not to use cache (remove the option not to precompute state vectors...)
-try to create global cahce to use in multithreading
-put all simulation parameters (multithread, excited_state... eetc) in config


-READABILITY AND SCALABILITY
* spin-compliment excitations: fix printing, fix orders, fix readability

*********************************************

1. Implementation for Riggeti real QPU

2.For the quantum simulator/devices backgrounds implement different methods for calculating <H>
     - UHU*
     - using the  overlap method
     - others?

3. Add functionality to choose encoding method


8.Excited states functionality



IDEAS for algorithms and papers:

-computing excited states
-other VQE applications
-different classical optimizers for different ansatz elements: gradient descent for excitations; direct search otherwise
****************
-GO CRAZY: try implemented ML for ansatz optimization
****************


Notes:
1. QUBIT ORDER
-qiskit uses the right most qubit as the MSB; statevector simulator produces correct statevector
-openfermion produces statevector corresponding to reversed qubit order

2. State preparation of QISKIT requires much more time than energy calculation
=> therefore no point finding explicitly the <H> when simulating

3. Adaptive ansatz should theoretically correct for Trotter approximation
