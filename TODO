1. Create Backgrounds; classes to construct and calculate H, as either a matrix or as quantum_circuits/states on a quantum simulator or
    a real device.

2.For the quantum simulator/devices backgrounds implement different methods for calculating <H>
     - UHU*
     - using the  overlap method
     - others?

3. Add functionality to choose encoding method

4.Search for best classical optimizer

5.Add thresholds for convergence

6. Counting number of gates/circuit depth functionality

7. Custom ansatz functionality

8.Excited states functionality

9. Multi-threading
