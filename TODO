Create Backgrounds; classes to construct and calculate H, as either a matrix or as quantum_circuits/states on a quantum simulator or
    a real device.


For the quantum simulator/devices backgrounds implement different methods for calculating <H>
     - UHU*
     - using the  overlap method
     - others?
